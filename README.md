# Kickstart-My-Chart
We are intending to do some basic analysis of a 4114 sample size of Kickstarter campaigns and what fields may indicate a relatively successful campaign. This will primarily be done in Microsoft Excel.

Guiding questions and additional analysis on 'Kickstarter Success Breakdowns.xlsx' are outlined in 'Conclusions.docx'.

Any resources used as well as personal introspection on work done on 'Kickstarter Success Breakdowns.xlsx' are outlined in the 'Sources, Collaboration, and Thoughts.docx'.
